Step 1
Questions:
Onboarding Video and Guide
To help you understand FI’s methodology, please (1) watch the video below in its entirety, and (2) read the "Founder Onboarding Guide". List two or three things you learned in the field below, and then click "Submit" to complete this deliverable.

Answers:
FI assigned me in Validate track: focus on validating problem/solution, market research, customer interviews and team-building. 

For the program the commitment should be 20 hrs/week, deliverables each week, 2 hr meeting (1 program meeting, 1 office hour). Moreover, we are in a team and we should meet hour group each week. 

Pitch is very important! Pitching everytime.. 

Step 2
Questions:
Rule of One
The "Rule of One" is a core principle that the FI company-building methodology follows. It emphasizes focusing on solving one problem, for one customer, with one product, one killer feature, and one revenue stream. Watch the full video, and then describe one or two of the core things you learned or found interesting in the field below.

Answers:
That is a vey interesting video which explains that a startup must follow the rule of one. First of all, it must focus on one problem: with a good solution our customers create the product roadmap of new features for us. 
One customer, well identified (age, type of work, level of education, ...) and we have to prepare a questionnaire: 
1. what is the hardest part about …? 
2. why was that hard?
3. have you looked for a solution? If no, why not?
4. why is that solution not ideal?
5. will you be willing to pay to solve this problem?

one killer feature and several methods to validate features (Concierge MVP,  Piecemeal, ...) for one product

one revenue: no adv business model

Step 3
Questions:
Founder Dashboard
Familiarize yourself with your Founder Dashboard, and explore all the tabs on your Navigation Bar. On your "Account" page, complete any missing information and upload a Profile Image. On your Founder Dashboard Homepage, review all the Session Dates on the timeline and add them to your calendar. Then, scroll down to the "Bonus Sessions & Events" section, which lists optional events that you can attend to further your learning. Find an event that appeals to you, and register for it. Enter the name of the event in the field below.

Step 4
Questions:
Program Tracks
FI segments Founders into three tracks: Validate, Launch or Traction. You can see your track on the top of this page. The Validate Track is designed to help idea-stage founders validate a startup idea and build a team. The Launch Track is designed to help founders and teams with a validated idea to launch and initially grow their business. The Traction Track is designed to help founders and teams with a live product and existing traction to generate the metrics needed to raise funding. If you feel that you are not on the right track, then please email megant@founderinstitute.com to explain why. Paste a copy of the email contents below.

Answers:
I think I'm in the right track: Validate Track

Step 5
Questions:
Onboarding Office Hours
Onboarding Office Hours become available 2 weeks before the start date of the program. After this time, you will see an "Office Hours" button appear on your Founder Dashboard Homepage and Navigation Bar. Once they are available, be sure to schedule Onboarding Office Hours with at least one Director. To prepare for the meeting, take some time to reflect on the following questions: (1) what is your goal for your business 1 year from now?, (2) what skills do you feel you need to develop in order to achieve this goal?, and (3) what business goals do you hope to accomplish during this 4 month program? Prepare a bullet point list of topics for the meeting agenda and paste it below.

Answers:
How to evaluate the timing? Often, I think we are late because companies have a product, or sometimes I think it's too early for skeptical companies.

What about the costs? Our prototype costs 300+ dollars for cloud

General suggestions about to create a good or the best MVP? how to find the product market fit?

Step 6
Questions:
Hotseat Pitch
There are two types of weekly pitches in the FI Program: "Hotseat Pitches", and "Feedback Pitches". You prepare for both of these pitches in the last 3 deliverables of every Sprint. In a "Hotseat Pitch", you pitch your startup or startup idea to the entire cohort for ratings and feedback. In future weeks, you will create longer pitch decks and upload videos of your Hotseat Pitch on your Founder Dashboard on a weekly basis. For the Accelerator Kickoff Session, we will start off slow and just ask that you create a simple One-Sentence Pitch using FI's One-Sentence Pitch Format, which you can find below. This is harder than it looks, and being clear and concise is a critical skill for building a company. Please take your time to review the video, create your first one-sentence pitch, and enter it below. If you are just working on an idea, then just describe one of the ideas you are considering pursuing using this format.

Step 7
Questions:
Feedback Pitch Learning
The second type of weekly pitch is the "Feedback Pitch", where you go deeper and present your strategy or progress on one specific component of your business - such as your Revenue Model, Go-To-Market Plan, etc. These pitches are designed to give you deeper feedback from Mentors and to ensure that you are making strong choices as you form strategies to build your business. In each sprint, you will have a "Feedback Pitch Learning" deliverable, like this one, that provides you with resources to review in order to prepare your Feedback Pitch. For the Accelerator Kickoff Session, we will start off slow and just ask that you prepare a 30 second introduction of yourself to deliver during the session. Simply write "Okay" below and continue on to "Feedback Pitch Prep".

Answers:
Okay

Step 8
Questions:
Feedback Pitch Prep
The Accelerator Kickoff Session is designed to introduce everyone and their startups (or startup ideas) to help us all discover any similarities or synergies within the cohort. Please create a 4 sentence introduction below, that covers (1) your name and where you are based, (2) your skillset / professional background, (3) why you enrolled in Founder Institute, and (4) the One-Sentence Pitch you created in the "Hotseat Pitch" deliverable above. Do not use more than 4 sentences total. During the session, you will introduce yourself using this format in 1 minute or less.
