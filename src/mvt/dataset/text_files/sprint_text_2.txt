Feedback Pitch Learning - Your "Why"
Successful Founders craft a strong "Why" and Vision for their business to inspire others to join and support their project, while also setting a clear culture for their business as it grows. Review the resources below, and then select your favorite Vision Statement from the corporate examples given. Write that Vision Statement below, and describe why you like it in 1-2 sentences.

Vision: my team and I want to provide advanced software documentation tools

Step 4
Questions:
Feedback Pitch Prep - Why Statement
During the Feedback Pitch portion of the next session, you will share your One-Sentence Pitch, followed by a 3-5 sentence "Why Statement". To create your "Why Statement", consider these questions: (1) What was the initial inspiration behind your idea?, (2) What is the key trend or societal change that you see happening that is most relevant to your idea?, (3) Why is it important for the world that your company exists?, (4) What is an ambitious future societal state that you want your startup to be a big part of creating in 10-20 years? Finally, take these answers and combine them into a concise, 3-5 sentence "Why Statement" that tells a cohesive story about why your company exists and inspires others to join your project. Remember: you need to deliver this entire Feedback Pitch in 1 minute or less, and you will be timed.

Answers:
The first inspiration behind my idea was a community meeting: an attendee talked about software developers issues. The key trend is the usability of the software documentation. Because, my team and I are investigating how to save much time related to documentation reading.
